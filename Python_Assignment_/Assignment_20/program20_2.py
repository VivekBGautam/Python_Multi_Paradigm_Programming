# 2. : Design a Python application that creates two threads named EvenFactor and
# OddFactor.

# Both threads should accept one integer number as a parameter.
# The EvenFactor thread should:
# Identify all even factors of the given number.
# Calculate and display the sum of even factors.
# The OddFactor thread should:
# Identify all odd factors of the given number.
# Calculate and display the sum of odd factors.
# After both threads complete execution, the main thread should display the message:
# "Exit from main"
