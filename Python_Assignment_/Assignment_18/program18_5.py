# 5.Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
# contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
# should filter out all prime numbers. Map function will multiply each number by 2. Reduce will
# return Maximum number from that numbers. (You can also use normal functions instead of
# lambda functions).

# Input List = [2, 70, 11, 10, 17, 23, 31, 77]
# List after filter = [2, 11, 17, 23, 31]
# List after map = [4, 22, 34, 46, 62]
# Output of reduce = 62
