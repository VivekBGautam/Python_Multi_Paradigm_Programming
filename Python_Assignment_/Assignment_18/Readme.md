## Assignment Questions

### Question 1

Write a program which contains one **lambda function** that accepts one parameter and returns the **power of two**.

**Input:** 4
**Output:** 16

**Input:** 6
**Output:** 64

---

### Question 2

Write a program which contains one **lambda function** that accepts two parameters and returns their **multiplication**.

**Input:** 3 4
**Output:** 12

**Input:** 3 6
**Output:** 18

### Question 3

Write a program which contains **filter()**, **map()**, and **reduce()** in it. Python application contains one list of numbers accepted from the user.

* Filter should filter out all numbers which are **greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 90**.
* Map function should **increase each number by 10**.
* Reduce should return the **product of all numbers**.

**Input List:**

```
[4, 34, 36, 76, 68, 24, 89, 23, 86, 90, 45, 70]
```

**List after filter:**

```
[76, 89, 86, 90, 70]
```

**List after map:**

```
[86, 99, 96, 100, 80]
```

**Output of reduce:**

```
6538752000
```

### Question 4

Write a program which contains **filter()**, **map()**, and **reduce()** in it. Python application contains one list of numbers accepted from the user.

* Filter should filter out all **even numbers**.
* Map function should calculate the **square** of each number.
* Reduce should return the **addition of all numbers**.

**Input List:**

```
[5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 8, 10]
```

**List after filter:**

```
[2, 4, 4, 2, 8, 10]
```

**List after map:**

```
[4, 16, 16, 4, 64, 100]
```

**Output of reduce:**

```
204
```

### Question 5

Write a program which contains **filter()**, **map()**, and **reduce()** in it. Python application contains one list of numbers accepted from the user.

* Filter should filter out all **prime numbers**.
* Map function should **multiply each number by 2**.
* Reduce should return the **maximum number** from the list.

**Input List:**

```
[2, 70, 11, 10, 17, 23, 31, 77]
```

**List after filter:**

```
[2, 11, 17, 23, 31]
```

**List after map:**

```
[4, 22, 34, 46, 62]
```

**Output of reduce:**

```
62
```
