# Assignment_14 : (Lambda Functions in Pytho)

## Description

This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing lambda (anonymous) functions in Python. Lambda functions are small, one-line functions used for simple operations, improving code readability and conciseness.

The programs in this assignment demonstrate the use of lambda functions for mathematical operations, logical checks, and comparisons.

---

## Objectives

To understand the syntax and usage of lambda functions

To perform basic arithmetic operations using lambda expressions

To apply conditional logic with lambda functions

To improve functional programming skills in Python

---

## List And Description of Programs

Write a lambda function which accepts one number and returns square of that number.

Write a lambda function which accepts one number and returns cube of that number.

Write a lambda function which accepts two numbers and returns maximum number.

Write a lambda function which accepts two numbers and returns minimum number.

Write a lambda function which accepts one number and returns True if number is even, otherwise False.

Write a lambda function which accepts one number and returns True if number is odd, otherwise False.

Write a lambda function which accepts one number and returns True if number is divisible by 5.

Write a lambda function which accepts two numbers and returns addition.

Write a lambda function which accepts two numbers and returns multiplication.

Write a lambda function which accepts three numbers and returns largest number.
