1: Write a Python program to implement a class named Demo with the following
specifications:

. The class should contain two instance variables: no1 and no2.

. The class should contain one class variable named Value.

. Define a constructor (

· Implement two instance methods:

o Fun () - displays the values of instance variables no1 and no2.

o Gun () - displays the values of instance variables no1 and no2.

Create two objects of the Demo class as follows:

Obj1 = Demo(11, 21)

Obj2 = Demo(51, 101)

Call the instance methods in the given sequence:

Obj1.Fun()

Obj2.Fun()
Obj1.Gun()
Obj2.Gun()

init ) that accepts two parameters and initializes the instance variables.

init

) that initializes all instance variables to 0.0.

2: Write a Python program to implement a class named Circle with the following
requirements:

. The class should contain three instance variables: Radius, Area, and Circumference.

. The class should contain one class variable named PI, initialized to 3.14.

Define a constructor
Implement the following instance methods:

o Accept () - accepts the radius of the circle from the user.

CalculateArea ( ) - calculates the area of the circle and stores it in the Area variable.

. CalculateCircumference() - calculates the circumference of the circle and stores it in
the Circumference variable.

. Display ( ) - displays the values of Radius, Area, and Circumference.

. Create multiple objects of the Circle class and invoke all the instance methods for each object.
