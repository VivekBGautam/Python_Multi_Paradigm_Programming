## Program Details

🔹 1. Area of Rectangle

Accepts length and width of a rectangle and prints its area.

Input: 10 5
Output: 50

🔹 2. Area of Circle

Accepts radius of a circle and prints the area of the circle.

Input: 7
Output: 153.86

🔹 3. Perfect Number Check

Accepts a number and checks whether it is a perfect number.

Input: 6
Output: Perfect Number

🔹 4. Binary Equivalent

Accepts a number and prints its binary representation.

Input: 10
Output: 1010

🔹 5. Grade Calculator

Accepts marks and displays grade according to the following conditions:

Marks	Grade
≥ 75	Distinction
≥ 60	First Class
≥ 50	Second Class
< 50	Fail
