# Assignment_15 - Python Lambda Functions Assignment

## Assignment Title
Python Lambda Functions Using `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`

---

## Assignment Description
This assignment demonstrates the use of **lambda functions** in Python along with the functional programming tools **`map()`**, **`filter()`**, and **`reduce()`**.  

Each program focuses on:
- Creating lambda functions
- Applying `map()` to transform lists
- Applying `filter()` to select specific elements
- Applying `reduce()` to aggregate list elements
- Performing mathematical and logical operations on numbers and strings
