# Assignment 29 – File Handling in Python

---

## Assignment Title

**File Handling Operations using Python**

---

## Aim

The aim of this assignment is to understand and implement various **file handling operations** in Python such as:

* Checking file existence
* Reading file contents
* Copying data between files
* Comparing two files
* Counting frequency of a string in a file

These programs strengthen concepts related to **files, command line arguments, and string processing**.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Basic knowledge of file handling
* Command line usage (for some programs)

---

## Assignment Problems

### 🔹 Q1) Check File Exists in Current Directory

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program which accepts a file name from the user and checks whether that file exists in the current directory or not.

**Input:**
Demo.txt

**Expected Output:**
Display whether `Demo.txt` exists or not.

**Concepts Used:**

* os module
* File existence checking

---

### 🔹 Q2) Display File Contents

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program which accepts a file name from the user, opens that file, and displays the entire contents on the console.

**Input:**
Demo.txt

**Expected Output:**
Display contents of `Demo.txt` on console.

**Concepts Used:**

* File open and read operations
* Reading complete file data

---

### 🔹 Q3) Copy File Contents into a New File (Command Line)

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program which accepts an existing file name through command line arguments, creates a new file named `Demo.txt`, and copies all contents from the given file into `Demo.txt`.

**Input (Command Line):**
ABC.txt

**Expected Output:**
Create `Demo.txt` and copy contents of `ABC.txt` into `Demo.txt`.

**Concepts Used:**

* Command line arguments
* File read and write operations
* File copy logic

---

### 🔹 Q4) Compare Two Files (Command Line)

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program which accepts two file names through command line arguments and compares the contents of both files.

* If both files contain the same contents, display **Success**
* Otherwise display **Failure**

**Input (Command Line):**
Demo.txt Hello.txt

**Expected Output:**
Success OR Failure

**Concepts Used:**

* Command line arguments
* File comparison
* String comparison 

---

### 🔹 Q5) Frequency of a String in File

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program which accepts a file name and one string from the user and returns the frequency (count of occurrences) of that string in the file.

**Input:**
Demo.txt Marvellous

**Expected Output:**
Count how many times `Marvellous` appears in `Demo.txt`.

**Concepts Used:**

* File reading
* String processing
* Frequency counting

---

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:

* Work confidently with files in Python
* Use command line arguments effectively
* Perform file comparison operations
* Analyze file content using string functions
