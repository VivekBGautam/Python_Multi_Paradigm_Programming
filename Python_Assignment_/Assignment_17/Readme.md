## Assignment Description

This assignment focuses on understanding **user-defined functions**, **modules**, **loops**, and **pattern printing** in Python.
It also covers logical programs such as **factorial**, **prime number checking**, **digit operations**, and **factor calculations**.

## Assignment Questions

### Question 1

Create one module named as **Arithmetic** which contains four functions as:

* `Add()` for addition
* `Sub()` for subtraction
* `Mult()` for multiplication
* `Div()` for division

All functions accept two parameters as numbers and perform the respective operation.
Write a Python program which calls all the functions from the **Arithmetic** module by accepting parameters from the user.

### Question 2

Write a program which accepts one number and displays the following pattern.

**Input:** 5
**Output:**

```
                *   *   *   *   *
                *   *   *   *   *
                *   *   *   *   *
                *   *   *   *   *
                *   *   *   *   *
```

### Question 3

Write a program which accepts one number from the user and returns its **factorial**.

**Input:** 5
**Output:** 120

---

### Question 4

Write a program which accepts one number from the user and returns the **addition of its factors**.

**Example:**
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6)

**Input:** 6
**Output:** 16

---

### Question 5

Write a program which accepts one number from the user and checks whether the number is **prime or not**.

**Input:** 5
**Output:** It is Prime Number

---

### Question 6

Write a program which accepts one number and displays the following pattern.

**Input:** 5
**Output:**

```
                *   *   *   *   *
                *   *   *   *   
                *   *   *   
                *   *  
                * 
```

### Question 7

Write a program which accepts one number and displays the following number pattern.

**Input:** 5
**Output:**

```
                1   2   3   4   5
                1   2   3   4   5  
                1   2   3   4   5  
                1   2   3   4   5 
                1   2   3   4   5 
```

### Question 8

Write a program which accepts one number and displays the following pattern.

**Input:** 5
**Output:**

```
                1  
                1   2    
                1   2   3    
                1   2   3   4 
                1   2   3   4   5 
```
